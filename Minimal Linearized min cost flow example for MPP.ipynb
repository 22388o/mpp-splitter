    "This is a minimalistic demonstration to transform the [minimum convex cost problem to find the most likely payment flow on the Lightning network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05322) to a [piecewise linearized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise_linear_function) problem that can be solved in sub second time on the current channel graph with the help of a [linear min cost flow solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/graph/min_cost_flow). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Main idea and mathematical background of piece wise linearization\n",
    "Using the ideas of [probabilistic payment delivery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08576) (sometimes known as probabilistic path finding) which has been already [implemented](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/4771) and [tested by c-lightning](https://medium.com/blockstream/c-lightning-v0-10-2-bitcoin-dust-consensus-rule-33e777d58657) as well as [implemented by LDK](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/pull/1227) (aka rust lightning) we know that the cost function to assign to assign the amount $a$ to a channel of capacity $c$ to use when selecting channels should be \n",
    "\n",
    "$f_c(a) = -\\log\\left(\\frac{c+1-a}{c+1}\\right)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The linear approximation of this cost function can be found by looking at the first term of the [Taylor Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) which turns out to be: \n",
    "\n",
    "$l_c(a) = \\frac{a}{c}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The linearized term is easy to compute and interprete: The cost of using the channel is $0$ if no amount is assigned to it and $1$ if the channel is fully saturated. For all other amounts the cost is just proportional to the fraction of saturation. (We note that this term (even thout we started to approximate the negativ log of the successprobability) is also the failure probabliity of a payment)\n",
    "\n",
    "However just using the linearized version yields two problems in practise: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. the unit cost $\\frac{1}{c}$ is a float and not an integer (**making it hard for many mcf solving algorithms**!)\n",
    "2. The linear nature of the problem (like the linear feerate) tends to fully saturate cheap paths which from a reliablity perspective is a very poor choice as fully saturated channels have the lowest probability to be successfull.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the first problem with floating values as unit costs we multiply all unit costs with $C_{max}$ as the max capacity that is observed on the channel graph. This will just be a linear scaling of the global cost function and thus not change the solution that minimizes the the cost objective. Of course we still have to round down to integers to make integer unit costs. The function will look like: \n",
    "\n",
    "$L_c(a) = a\\cdot\\lfloor\\frac{C_{max}}{c}\\rfloor$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate the second problem instead of using a single linearized cost function on the entire channel we split the channel in $N$ sements (in our case of equal size to demonstrate a point about runtime. (From an approximation perspective one might want to use the optimal piecewise linear approximation which can also be found via: http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCECS2008/WCECS2008_pp1191-1194.pdf). So when building the linear approximation of the **uncertainty network** instead of adding one channel with capacity $c$ for each channel we add $N$ channels each of capacity $\\frac{c}{N}$. The unit cost of the i-th piecewise linearized channel (with $i\\in\\{0,...,N-1\\}$) increases via the following formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "$L_{c,i}(a) = L_{c}(a)\\cdot(i+1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation of this choice for the cost function on the piecewise linear segments\n",
    "When using a linear min cost flow solver the unit cost can be seen as the derrivative of the cost function. with the formular $L_{c,i}(a) = L_{c}(a)\\cdot(i+1)$ the unit cost is linearly increasing of every segment of the channel. This effectively behaves like piecewise approximation of a quadratic cost function (the derrivative of a quadratic function grows linearly as our adopted piecewise lienar cost function). \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course in practise one would approximate the derrivative of the negative log probabilities for the boundaries of the piecewise segments and probably one would not use segments of equal size.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this code is to demonstrate feasability of runtime (the linearized model of the **uncertainty network** on which we calculates has $N$ times as many edges as the convex problem) this very pragmatic and easy to be implemented choice will be good enough. More work needs to be conducted to make a proper piecewise linear approximation. For example it seems very logical to split of the certain part of the liquidity to have capacity of the certain liquidity and cost 0 (which corresponds to probability 1) but we leave this for future and engineering when implementing into nodes, wallets or LSPs.\n",
