    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Payment) Channel\n",
    "Payment `channel`s are either announced or unnannounced but known to the sender and recpient of a payment. They have meta data like the `capacity` or `routing fees` as well as some other config values which we ignore for simplicity here.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Arc\n",
    "An `arc` is not to be confused with a payment `channel`. `Arc`s are the data structure that arise from the piece wise linearized `cost function` and are used internally in the min cost flow solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Channel) Capacity\n",
    "The `capacity` of a payment channel is its size as observed in the amount of the output of the funding transaction which is announced via the `short_channel_id` in gossip.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: It seems to be an unavoidable collision that the term capacity is also used for `arcs` in min cost flow solvers. As I introduce the piece wise linearization the `cost function` the arcs in the min cost flow solve will usually have a lower `capacity` than the cannels they represent. I try to distinguish this by talking either about the `channel capacity` or the `arc capacity` if absolutely necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Liquidity\n",
    "The `Liquidity` is the amount of satoshis a peer has available to route on it's channel. This means that unless the (even) `capacity` is split exactly 50/50 between the peers the `liquidity` in a channel will be different for both peers. \n",
    "\n",
    "typical terms in the wild: balance, local balance, outbound capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uncertainty / Entropy \n",
    "assuming a prior probability distribution we can quantify the `uncertainty` about the channels `liquidity` by measureing the `entropy` of the probability function. Notably if a channel as a `capacity` of `c` satoshis the entropy is `log(c+1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unertainty Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The `uncertainty network` is a model than encodes our current belief about the available `liquidity` in the channels of the Lightning network. This is usually achieved by storing three values: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Minimum `liquidity` which initialy for remote channel is `0`. \n",
    "2. Maximum `liquidity` which initially for remote channels corresponds its `capacity`.\n",
    "3. `inflight` is the number of satoshis that we currently have allocated to this channel in outstanding onions and HTLCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## inflight\n",
    "We use `inflight` to encode how many satoshis we have currently allocated or plan to allocate to a channel. Note that this is not the same as the number of inflight htlcs that the peer co-owning the channel will observe as some of the onions that we have outstanding may not have been delivered to the channel yet or may have failed but not returend back to us yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cost(function)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cost` function encodes our optimization goals and consists of several `features`. typical `features` are the `uncertainty cost` and the `routing fees`. Note that the same cost function can be applied to Dijkstra's algorithm as to min cost flow solvers. However in the general case of min cost flows the cost function should be convex or even better linear or piecewise linear so that a reasonable runtime can be achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `cost` is just an internal value that will be minimized in computation of `candidate paths` for the `payment loop`. This cost may or may not translate to `routing fees`.\n",
    "\n",
    "typical terms in the wild: Score, fees, penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit cost\n",
    "Linear min cost flow solvers need a fixed cost for transporting 1 unit (e.g. 1 satoshi) along an `arc` (e.g. `channel`). Oft\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uncertainty cost\n",
    "This is the `feature` introduced in the [`probablistic payment delivery` paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08576) it puts a cost on an amount `a` to be send over a (`path`) of `payment channels`.\n",
    "It is comuted by taking the negative logarithm of the `success probability` if we have no prior belief of the channel the `uncertainty cost` will be computed as: `-log((c+1-a)/(c+1))`. Note that the uncertainty cost is a convex gowing function takin the value `0 = -log((c+1-0)/(c+1)) = -log(1)` if no sats are to be allocated on the channel. The maximum possible `uncertainty cost` occurs if `a=c` and takes the value `log(c+1)` which is exactly the `entropy` of the channel which can be seen by the following calculation:\n",
    "`-log((c+1-c)/(c+1)) = -log(1/(c+1)) = log(c+1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### linearized uncertainty cost\n",
    "The linearized uncertainty cost is the first term of the taylor approximation of `f(a)=-log((c+1-a)/(c+1))` which results in `a/(c+1)`. This (in my opinion surprisingly) corresponds to the failure probability. Note that we should not interpret it as such as it does not make sense to add probabilities while those feature will be added in the global `cost function` of the min cost flow solvers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This results in a `unit` cost of `1/(c+1)`. since integers are preferable we multiply the unit cost with the maximum observed channel `capacity` of all channels and ignoring the decimals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the **final integer linearized uncertainty unit cost** is: `int(c_{max}/(c+1))`\n",
    "\n",
    "## (routing) fees\n",
    "\n",
    "The routing `fee` is a feature that usually corresponds directly to the fees that are being charged to forward a payment of size `a` along a channel. According to the protocol it is currently being computed as: \n",
    "\n",
    "`fee(a) = a*ppm/1000 + base_fee_msat`\n",
    "\n",
    "## linearized fees\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in our research and on the mailinglist the fee function of the lightning network is not linear. In the mentioned discussion one can see that `fee(a+b) = fee(a)+fee(b) - base_fee_msat` which is linear if and only if `base_fee_msat = 0`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus in computation we currently linearize the `fee` function by ignoring the `base fee` so we use `fee(a) = a*ppm/1000` giving us a `unit cost` of `ppm/1000` \n",
    "\n",
    "As min cost flow solvers prefer integer cost we scale by `1000` and arrive at the **final integer linearized fee unit cost** which is just the: `ppm`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this to work good enough we might also take channel that charge a very small `base_fee` and later just pay it when we send the onions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The `features` of our cost function encode our optimization goals. Typicalfeatures goals might be to have a cheap price (usually encoded by `fee`) or to have a high reliability (in this work best encoded by the `uncertainty cost`that comes from the estimated `success probability` that the channel has enough `liquidity`. Other features that seam reasonable are things related to `latency` of payments (e.g. [pyhsical geodistance or virtaul IP-distance as indicted in this comment](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/issues/1170)). Implementations have also experimented with other features like CLTV delta or channel age. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a crucial part for future research \n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of the `success probability` is in our case modelled by estimating the likelihood that a channel with a `capacity` of `c` has `a` sats of `liquidity` available. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the base case where we have not learnt anything about the channel's `liquidity` in the past the `success probability` for making a payment of size `a` stays at `P(X>=a) = (c+1-a)/(c+1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say a payment delivery algorithm sends an onion via a path of channel and wants to add an HTLC with amount `h` to a channel of capacity `c` there are several cases that we can observe to update our uncertainty about the network for future payments of size `a`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Payment failed at the channel: This means the channel of capacity `c` has at most `h-1` satoshi in it. In Terms of Probability theory we can ask ourselves what is the success rate for a subsequent payment of size `a` given the event `X<h` (the htlc  `h` has failed) which can be expressed as `P(X>=a | X<h)`. Here we see because of the condition that for `a>=h` the proabbility has to be `0`. Computing the conditional probability for the remainder in the uniform case we can se `P(X>=a | X < h) = (h-a)/h`. Note that this is the same as the success probability for a channel of capacity `h-1`. \n",
    "2. Payment failed at a downstream channel: This means that the channel of capcity `c` was able to route `h` satoshi and has at least a minimum `liquidity` of `h`. This means that `P(X>=a | X>=h) = 1`  for all amounts `a <=h` and in the unform case for all larger values of `a` the conditional probability materializes to: `P(X>=a)/P(X>=h) = ((c+1-a)/(c+1))/((c+1-h)/(c+1)) = (c+1-a)/(c+1-h)` Note that this fraction is always smaller than `1` as `a >=h`\n",
    "3. The case that the payment was successfull or did not return an error: Following the same thoughts and the first bullet point at the end of section 3 in the second paper we know that for a future payment of size `a` we have to look at `P(X>=a + h | X >=h)` which in the uniform case materializes to `( (c-h) + 1 - a)/( (c - h) + 1)`. Note that this is the same as if the channel shrunk from `c` to `c-h` as we now know that the maximum `liquidity` is not `c` but rather `c-h`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## optimal payment flow / optimal mpp split\n",
    "\n",
    "We call a payment flow optimal if it minimizes the `cost function` that encodes our optimization goals. Note that the solution of the min cost flow problem also defines a split of the payment across various paths. While simple algorithms for discecting a flow into paths exist the actual disection is not uique and needs further research. Especially when we start taking channel configurations into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Payment Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The payment loop is the trial and error process of delivering a certain amount of satoshis from a sending node to a recipient. This is usually done by generating a set of candidate onions from the solution of an `optimal payment flow`. The onions are concurrently being sent out and error are being used to update our belief about the `liquidity` in the `uncertainty network`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probabilistic Payment Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of `probabilistic payment delivery` is to send onions that maximize the success proabbility for all (or parts of them) to be successul. This takes the `uncertainty` about the remote `liquidity` into consideration and was first introduced in path finding (Note I did not use the term path findng nore did I put it in the glossary)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pickhardt Payments\n",
    "As the term is more and more starting to flow around I will try to summarize best what is currently from a technial point of view meant by it: \n",
    "\n",
    "`Using probabilistic payment delivery` in a round based `payment loop` that updeates our belief of the remote `liquidity` in the `uncertainty network` and generates reliable and cheap `payment flows` in every round by solving a `piece wise linearized min integer cost flow problem with a seperable cost function` (I start to see why a shorter term was needed)."
